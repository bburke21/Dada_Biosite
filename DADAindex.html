<p>Dadaism is also known as the Dada movement, and it begins in Switzerland. Many thought that nationalism was the result of World War 1 and the war aroused the Dadaism movement. There was also an influence of Constructivism, Cubism, Expressionism, and Futurism on Dadaism(Dada Movement Overview and Key Ideas | TheArtStory). The Dadaism movement was highly diverse, which included performance art of painting, poetry, sculpture, collage, and photography. Mockery of materialistic and nationalistic attitudes is the aesthetics of Dadaism. With the establishment of Surrealism, the movement of Dadaism vanished. However, the ideas of the Dadaism movement are part of contemporary and modern art. According to German writer Hugo Ball, the form of humans is disappearing in paintings. The war alone does not give birth to the Dada movement, but science and technology also provoked it(Dada Movement Overview and Key Ideas | TheArtStory).</p>

<div align=right>   <p align=left>Marcel Duchamp was part of Dadaism, and he was known for his famous work of paintings, sculptures, and collages. He used his art for the cultural protest after World War 1. His sculpture ‘Fountain’ was one of the iconic art pieces of that time. His other famous art was ‘L.H.O.O.Q. He created the art from a postcard of Leanardo’s Mona Lisa(Dadaism: 10 Iconic Artworks From The Dada Art Movement | TheCollector). This piece of art was satire, which rejects the pleasing sight of high art. Kurt Schwitters was another Dadaism artist from Germany who created art with different mediums, including sculpture, painting, and graphic design. His famous piece of art was Construction for Noble Ladies. He used broken pieces of material to create this art piece. An Austrian artist of the Dada movement, Raoul Hausmann was an expressionist artist. His famous piece of art from the Dada movement was The Art Critic.  He used photographs, magazines, and newspapers in his art. Another member of the Dadaism movement, Hannah Hoch, used the technique of photomontage. Her famous art is known as ‘Cut with the Kitchen Knife’ shows; contrasts between mainstream culture and Dadaism. She showed a group of dominant personalities as; politicians, the army on one side, and artists and communists on the other side. Raoul Hausmann is known for his famous work named, The Mechanical Head. He used a hairdresser’s wig dummy, a pocket watch, a ruler, a wallet, and other items. His artwork shows the interaction of humanity with objects. The founding member of the Dadaist movement Jean Arp was a poet, painter, and sculptor. His famous art piece, Shirt Front and Fork, is a series of wooden sculptures. Francis Picabia was a French painter and his famous work ‘Optophone’ is an example of machinist work. Man Ray was a significant member of Dadaism, and he was a visual artist and photographer. With the help of photographic paper, Ray created his masterpiece Rayograph. His art showed the notion of Dadaism because of the use of random objects which seemed unconnected.</p></div>

The color reduction was a prominent feature of the Dada movement. The color palette got reduced to primary colors and black highlights. The blending of artistic design and text was one of the main elements of Dada Art.  Hugo Ball wrote a poem, ‘KARAWANE’ in a variety of typefaces. The text was also part of artwork during the Dada movement, and most of the artists used paper as a print medium(Comparisons — DADA). However, the movement didn’t last long as it died down in the early parts of the 1920’s. </p>
